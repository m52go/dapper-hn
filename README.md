One day it struck me that it wouldn't take much to make HN look a lot better. Its simplicity is supremely functional. 

At the same time, while I appreciate the myriad clients people have made, I still really appreciate the charm of the original site.

So I made a stylesheet to retain the charm of the original site while smoothing out some of its rougher edge.

Changes made include:
* Background color is uniform throughout page.
* Font changed to Lato throughout, Raleway for numbers.
* Added spacing to top navigation bar.
* Removed logo border to better fit the space.
* Replaced up-vote button image, so it's sharp regardless of screen resolution.
* Added spacing around up-vote button.
* Added spacing between posts.
* Nicer "More" button at page bottom.

Here's a side-by-side comparison:

You can simply copy & paste the CSS in this repository into a new Stylish style applied to "news.ycombinator.com". Stylish is available for Firefox and Chrome. Check out [their homepage here](https://userstyles.org/)...there are lots of other custom styles available there for many other websites.
