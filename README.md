### an aesthetic revision of hn with all the function and most of the charm

One day it struck me that it wouldn't take much to make HN look a lot better. Its simplicity is supremely functional, but sometimes its 90s-era charm feels a bit stale.

So I made a stylesheet to retain the charm of the original site while smoothing out some of its rougher edge.

### what it does

Changes made include:
* Background color is uniform throughout page.
* Font changed to Lato throughout, Raleway for numbers.
* Added spacing to top navigation bar.
* Removed logo border to better fit the space.
* Replaced up-vote button image, so it's sharp regardless of screen resolution.
* Added spacing around up-vote button.
* Added spacing between posts.
* Nicer "More" button at page bottom.
